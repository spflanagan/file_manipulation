# subset_fasta_files
#This program reads in a fasta file and then pulls out only the relevant entries from a list


//Required information: 
//(1) a fasta file and 
//(2) a file with a list of strings to match
//The list file needs to have each query on its own line, 
//without the characteristic ">" preceding the names

//Optional: add a -c flag to the function call to have the program output ONE file
//with all of the subsetted fasta records Combined, rather than one file per record (default)

//Output:
//One file with the subset of data requested by the file

//Usage:
//Takes a list of query strings and creates a new file with data for individual observations matching the queries 
//-f: fasta file input (including path)
//-l: list of queries (including path)
//-c: Optional flag that indicates all records in list should be Combined into one file. Otherwise, one file per fasta ID is created.
//-h: Prints help message
//no arguments: interactive mode (as opposed to passing arguments to the program)
